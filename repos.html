			<dd>My <i>Personal</i> repository contains code projects that are too small or specific to
				warrant their own repository. I have made projects in every programming language I know.
				I mostly contribute to the <code>src/main/c</code> section of the source code as C is my
				favorite programming language.</dd>
			<dt><a href="https://github.com/mrf-dot/linuxize-school-pc" target="_blank">Linuxize PC</a></dt>
			<dd>A guide that allows someone familiar with programming on Unix or simply wants to try out
				Linux or *BSD without installing it to have <i>virtually</i> all the functionality and
				programs found on Unix in Windows.</dd>
			<dt><a href="https://github.com/mrf-dot/yt" target="_blank">YT</a></dt>
			<dd>A PowerShell script for watching and downloading YouTube videos and music over the command
				line. The script must have the programs MPV, yt-dlp (youtube-dl), and PowerShell
				installed to run properly (which are conveniently installed by the Linuxize PC script
				linked above. This script provides a more streamlined and nonaddictive way to watch
				YouTube.</dd>
